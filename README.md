# zx-blk-ciph
Test framework for Z80 ciphers.

Currently there are aes128, blowfish and speck ciphers available.

This is still a 'proof-of-concept' project, so there are no Z80 decryptors, only *en*cryptors.

The framework contains some test vectors (key, plaintext, ciphertext) and
applies them to the corresponding cipher implementations. Use make GCRYPT=1 to
build with gcrypt support (only for AES and Blowfish).

Build instructions:
0. go to directory
 cd tst/src
1. build pasmo assembler:
 cd pasmo
 ./configure
 make
2. build libz80 library:
 cd libz80
 make
3. build tests:
 make
4. run tests:
 ./main

You can also run specific Z80 tests only:
 ./main aes
or
 ./main bf
or
 ./main speck

Test vectors for aes and blowfish are taken from various public sources.
First test vector for speck taken from public source, others are generated by
me.
